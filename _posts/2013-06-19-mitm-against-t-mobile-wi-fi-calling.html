<p>We released a <a title="MITM Attack on T-Mobile WiFi Calling" href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~cthompson/t-mobile/" target="_blank">technical report on our MITM attack against T-Mobile's WiFi Calling service</a>, which I realized I never linked to this here. This was joint work with Jethro Beekman, another EECS grad student at Berkeley. Big takeaway: T-Mobile was great to work with on fixing this vulnerability---their security team is excellent.</p>
<p>We also have a WOOT 2013 paper that covers this and other attacks on cellular systems, but we are still working with vendors on that. Stay tuned.</p>
<p><strong>Update (2013/9/6):</strong> Our WOOT 2013 paper is published, and I've posted <a title="Breaking Cell Phone Authentication: Vulnerabilities in AKA, IMS andÂ Android" href="http://cthompson.co/2013/08/30/breaking-cell-phone-authentication-vulnerabilities-in-aka-ims-and-android/">some details and links to the paper, slides, and video</a>.</p>
