<p>From <a title="feross.org" href="http://www.feross.org/gcc-ownage/" target="_blank">feross.org</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Check out this little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection">GCC</a> gem that I just discovered <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=A436B63B-8EB4-4914-8041-B914B6E0992C&amp;displaylang=en">read about</a>.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>When GCC identified bad C++ code, it tried to start <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack">NetHack</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28computer_game%29">Rogue</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi#Applications">Towers of Hanoi</a>. Failing all three, GCC printed out a cryptic error message. Wow.</p>
<p>This just goes to show you that when the official C++ specification talks about undefined behavior, they mean business:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Undefined behavior is] behavior, such as might arise upon use of an erroneous program construct or erroneous data, for which the Standard imposes no requirements</p></blockquote>
<p>No requirements indeed.</p></blockquote>
<p>I found this immensely entertaining. "Undefined Behavior" indeed. Also, not surprising that those who have to use C++ could stand have some humor injected into their otherwise painful lives (I kid... kind of).</p>
